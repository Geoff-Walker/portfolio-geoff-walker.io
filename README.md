# About Me
Hi my names Geoff and I live in rural Lincolnshire with my beautiful wife Helen. After a nasty fall left me an amputee, my established career as an engineer ended abruptly, little did I know when I started coding as a hobby that my true calling for programming had only just begun. Since then I have fallen in love with programming and developed a talent for interactive UI/UX web development.

If you have a hybrid/remote employment opportunity or would like to discuss work on a freelance basis, please don't hesitate to contact me.

# My Portfolio
Like most other developers that have just completed their portfolio sites, it seemm a much fairer question to me, to ask what didnt I learn while creating my portfolio site. I think therefore its best to just give a brief summary of the challenges I faced and how I overcame them.  At the start of this project I made the very concious decision firstly not to do anything that felt "normal" or like a template and secondly have a completetly different theme on each page to show a spectrum of capabilities.  

__There are four main pages:__
1. Index - Home
2. Projects
3. About
4. Contact

__Responsive by Design__
In todays world all screen sizes need to be accomodated and I hope that I have achieved that in all browsers, however I wont mention it further again as I beleive this is just intrinsic and not worth further unpacking.


## Index - Home ##
When I was trying to come up with a design for my home page I wanted something that was dynamic and full of motion, I didn't however want the enormous download times that a big background video would bring. So I came up with the coke bubbles concept, self generated with javasdcript.  

Really liking a challenge and wanting to really perfect my animation skills I decided to try and recreate the Eta James classic "I dont want you", forever linked with the diet coke break adverts.  A little while later and after hearing a 30s loop more times than sanity should allow I came up with an animation that is accurate enough to evoke the song even in silence.  The diet coke break background artwork and all the cans and spray on this page were draw by myself in inkscape.

__Fancy hover__
I used data attributes in order to create a fancy hover effect using a before and after psuedo class on the nav links

__Light and Dark Theme__
I created a light and dark theme based either cola or lemonade

__Javascript Coke Bubbles__
Again I used a before and after on a javascript generated span element to create a bubble of either coke or lemonade depending on the light and dark theme.

__Diet Coke Animationm__
Really liking a challenge and wanting to really perfect my animation skills I decided to try and recreate the Eta James classic "I dont want you", forever linked with the diet coke break adverts.  A little while later and after hearing a thirty second loop more times than sanity should allow, I came up with an animation that is accurate enough to evoke the song even in silence.

__Artwork in Inkscape__
The diet coke break, background artwork and all the cans and spray on this page were draw by myself in inkscape.

## Projects ## 
The idea for this page was to have an elevator where each floor was a different project within the portfolio.  This was my biggest challenge by far I knew what I wanted to achieve but really had to look hard for effective tools like scroll-snap and the intersection observer in order to bring the vision to reality.  I really love the final effect especially on desktop.

## About ## 




## Existing Technologies used in anger 

__CSS Grid__
CSS grid is my favourite CSS layout tool. It has always made total sense to me out of the box.  To push the CSS Grid to a higher level, I also brought in a flexible column layout, using repeat min max. 

__Flexbox__
In my days of making simple components on Front End Mentor, Flexbox was probably my least favourite tool but these days after practicing, it seems as nearly intuitive as CSS Grid. 

__Animation__
I have used animations several times before and enjoyed the outcome. On this project, I used the animation property to give motion and interest to the landing page. 
    
__CSS variables__
Again, this is not the first time I have used CSS variables; they offer such a good tool to quickly respond to client requirements.  As I said above, this project never made it far enough to go through that stage but if the client had wanted to, all the fontsâ€™ colours and styles could be changed radically, with a simple change to the variables. (This is something that I will be making a prerequisite for all projects going forward). 


## New technologies used 
__Mask-image__
This took some time to set up and get thoroughly down but I feel it added a beautiful effect to the landing page.  When put in combination with the animation, this fluid transition of images, partially obscured by a paint brush effect mask, is super effective.  While this is not something I could see on all websites, the effect is striking, and I would definitely use that style of obscuration and animation to give motion again! 

__Google maps using Iframes__
While I have manipulated APIs and worked on geocoding and reverse geocoding, this felt like real overkill here, so I simply used a straightforward Iframe with a google maps link.  This was super simple and took no time at all to do. 


__Enquiry e-mail handling using the formsubmit.co API__
This took me a little while to get submitting smoothly but overall was a super simple addition to the functionality of the site 


__Paginated reviews container__
I personally felt that one of the biggest problems with the original online presence was a lack of reviews. I know the lady well and she is a very likeable. warm person.  However, she had no Facebook page to review, no reviews on the website and no trust pilot etc.  I felt this was a real problem, so I included a reviews container and implemented pagination on the reviews.  Although this took a while to implement, I felt it really added to context and presence online. 


__Lightbox__
A lightbox is an essential part of modern websites but was a new feature for me to implement. I want to be super honest in my project reflections and this is one feature, that whilst it works perfectly and all the images show well, I would rework it, as I don't like the position of the next/previous buttons in the lightbox.
