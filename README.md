# About Me
Hi my names Geoff and I live in rural Lincolnshire with my beautiful wife Helen. After a nasty fall left me an amputee, my established career as an engineer ended abruptly, little did I know when I started coding as a hobby that my true calling for programming had only just begun. Since then I have fallen in love with programming and developed a talent for interactive UI/UX web development.

If you have a hybrid/remote employment opportunity or would like to discuss work on a freelance basis, please don't hesitate to contact me. Thanks for taking the time to check me out, if you would like to know a little more about me and my work please take a look at my website: http://www.geoff-walker.io/
